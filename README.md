# Neural Network from Scratch – PyTorch

## Overview
This project demonstrates the development of a fully functional neural network from scratch using PyTorch, applied to the classic Iris Dataset.
It covers the entire machine learning pipeline — from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and visualization of performance.

## Dataset
Source: Iris Dataset

Description:

Features: 4 (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width)

Classes: 3 species of Iris flowers

The dataset is widely used for classification tasks and is ideal for demonstrating machine learning fundamentals.

## Implementation Details
Framework: PyTorch

Steps Covered:

Data loading & preprocessing (train/test split, normalization)

Model architecture design (fully connected layers, activation functions)

Forward pass & backward propagation

Loss computation (CrossEntropyLoss)

Optimization using stochastic gradient descent (SGD)

Model training & evaluation on test set

Accuracy calculation & performance reporting

## Results
Final Accuracy: High accuracy on test data, demonstrating strong classification performance.

The model effectively learns patterns in the dataset, achieving robust results without relying on pre-built high-level APIs.
