# Neural-Network  
Dataset: Iris Dataset â€“ 4 features, 3 classes.

Implementation: Developed a neural network entirely from scratch using PyTorch, covering data preprocessin, model architecture design, training loop, and evaluation.

Approach: Applied time series data processing techniques, implemented forward and backward propagation manually, and optimized using gradient descent.

Outcome: Achieved high prediction accuracy on test data, demonstrating strong performance in classification tasks.
